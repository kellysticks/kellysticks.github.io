#Intro to DOM and jQuery:

-The DOM is a big object and it creates a space for us to manipulate aspects of the webpage
-Allows us to see the structure of our webpages on a deeper level
-It allows us to get AND set data
-DOM is represented by the document object and JS has a bunch of built in methods that make manipulating the DOM easier

### Methods:
document.getElementById(String id)
-this gets the element you are looking for based on its id

Document.querySelector(String selector)
-only returns the first element with the passed selector

Document.querySelectorAll(String selector)
-selectors can be an element tag, a class, or it could be an id
-when you pass through string to target those elements, you'll use the same syntax as you do with CSS (so class is a . and id is a #)

-Using the DOM allows you to do a TON with elements, include create them
-When you call an alert directly in the HTML, it stops the page from loading 
-Defer makes it so the JS loads last

-JS should be in its own file and you want to include it in a window.onload function!!
-prevent default stops the page from executings its default behavior (usually refreshing)

document.getElementById retrieves a single element with a matching ID.
document.getElementsByClassName retrieves an array of elements that match the given class.
document.getElementsByTagName retrieves an array of elements that are of the given type.

jQuery and the DOM: Introduction
-jQuery has to load its whole library before it can be used, so sometimes that slows it down/or would slow down the webpage
-jQuery uses the same syntax as CSS
-$ is the shortand for jQuery
-you do not want to update styles using jquery
--the appropriate way to do this is by adding and removing classes
-window.Onload = document.ready for JQUERY
-jquery will listen for several events which is why we use "on" instead of "onclick" or something more specific

-An event is anything happening on a web page
-The entire page (i.e., DOM) has to load before you can access content on it or start manipulating it

DOM/jQuery Continued
-on method adds an event listener in jQuery
-can create a delegated event (which requires us to add element our event handler executes for) to the right side of our code
-Delegated Event Listener
-Target the items themselves, but can target the whole list and then pass the items through as an argument
-in event delgation, can pass in multiple event types (separated by a space)


Templating
-compiling is putting data together
-you import Handlebars into your html and then you reference it in the JS
-templates are useful to keep your data separate from your logic
-allows you to add elements with the same logic, style, format, etc.
